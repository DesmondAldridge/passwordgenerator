# passwordgenerator


Generates password based on criteria.






DISCLAIMER: This assignment is a bit incomplete. What it is doing now is treating the confirmed criteria as OPTIONS, not REQUIREMENTS. So within the amount of characters available (according to what the user chooses) it will draw from the options (of which the user has also chosen), BUT will not necessarily include all those options.

I'll try to figure out a way to remedy this, but it is very likely I'll be turning in the assignment as such.
