# passwordgenerator


Generates password based on criteria.


DISCLAIMER: This assignment is a bit incomplete. What it is doing now is treating the confirmed criteria as OPTIONS, not REQUIREMENTS. So within the amount of characters available (according to what the user chooses) it will draw from the options (of which the user has also chosen), BUT will not necessarily include all those options.

I'll try to figure out a way to remedy this, but it is very likely I'll be turning in the assignment as such


*** REFLECTIONS

Admittedly I needed help getting started on this one and throughout. If it's not an issue with logic, then it's an issue of not remembering what functions/methods/etc. are available to accuate whatever logical step I came up with. Also still just trying (and sometimes failing) recalling the syntactic rules and notation.

I looked at several examples, and the steps I took reflect that. I rewrote (sometimes modified) each step if I decided to go with that same approach (which was for most steps), but didn't move on from each step (or even decide to use that step) until I understood it.

Really I was so informed by the examples I viewed that it was stressing me out that this bordered on plagarism, but I really needed my handheld for this one as Javascript in general is still very alien to me.

I did learn (and reinforce what I've previously learned) a lot from this assignment, and I really hope moving forward I won't need to reference as many examples/precedents.
